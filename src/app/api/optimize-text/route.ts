### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic SWOT Analysis**  
- **Strengths**: Direct qualification matches  
- **Weaknesses**: Missing hard requirements  
- **Opportunities**: Transferable skills that could be leveraged  
- **Threats**: Potential deal-breakers (e.g., location constraints)  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Resume Scoring (0-100%)**
